### 0.2.12: Summer winds, Fireflies, Bugspray 4k

- Added Anomalous Dirt to Metamorphic Table recipes.
   - Changes itself depending on biome/nearby blocks. Also used in WorldGen.
- Added config-option to allow time to move normally, or be frozen at noon.
- Added config-option to make Underworld slightly less dark
- Added the Sugar Pile block.
   - Spawns Fireflies above it.
   - Aside from being very cosmetic, also protects you against hostile mobs.
- Hopefully fixed console spam for the last time. Restricted console output even more, and added a timer between messages.
- Added Moss Stone. Mossy variant of normal Stone. Usurps the name from Vanilla's cobblestone variant.
   - Added Firefly Moss Stone. Slightly glowing moss stone that occasionally shows a Firefly. Will be used more later.
- Started working on infrastructure for porting migraine inducing buildings, like villages & ocean temples, to easier-to-understand-and-use collections of blockstates.
