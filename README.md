Darkness. Stone all around you. You will never be able to reach the sun.

This is the Overworld. Now Underworld.

```diff
 - A complete re-write of this mod is under construction; Further updates will be for 1.12.2.
 - The update will bring a deeper cave-system, but also allow for proper worldgen above ground to add a semblance of cross-mod compatability.

### 0.3.12: Recipes by the Campfire

- Updated Mob-Spawning mechanics.
   - Squids are now being force-spawned manually.
   - Disabling force-spawn for Roots entities.
   - More than doubled amount of mobs allowed to co-exist in a 64x128x64 area (7-16).
- Updated JEI support to 3.14.7.416.
- Added MineTweaker Support for the Metamorphic Table.
   - Read [here](https://github.com/Matryoshika/Underworld/wiki/MineTweaker-Support) to learn how to add and remove recipes.
- Changed how the Sugar Pile's interact with hostile entities.
   - Removed the "Fireflies push hostiles away" ability.
   - Made Fireflies "daze" hostiles instead. Hostile entities will now freeze in place and watch the Fireflies.
- Trimmed the chance for Moss-Stone to spawn, from 5% to 4%.
- Removed the Sugar Pile from the creative tabs. Right-clicking sugar on the ground will still place them.
   - Placing the *sugar* down is vital to the pile's interaction with hostiles. Placing the *pile* down, directly circumvented it.
