Darkness. Stone all around you. You will never be able to reach the sun.

This is the Overworld. Now Underworld.

### 0.0.8: Bug Off!

- Should have fixed an issue where hundreds of Guardians would spawn in matter of minutes.
- Fixed the spawn-platform, dungeons & lilypad worldgen bleeding into other dimensions & worldtypes.
- Added Sugarcane to worldgen: Still quite rare. Might switch to custom sugar-cane variant instead. Any more often and sugarcane will plummet 
WorldGen to a standstill.
