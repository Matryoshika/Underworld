### Support

Once again, support requests & issue reports may be created on the official github.

Underworld comes as-is, with **no guarantees**, and the Player is responsible for anything he or she does with Underworld.

### Addon, Cross-Mod & API

Underworld will, once it has attained a proper level of usability, gain an API to allow other mods to work with it.

Underworld is planned to gain heavy amounts of Cross-Mod interactions with other World-Gen mods, for full support with all mods.

Pull-Requests to the official github are welcome, but decompiling, editing source-code, and recompiling, or ASM-injections, or Reflection, or 
even byte-code editing is not. If anything should be changed, to fix issues, or attain cross-mod interactions from Underworld's side, please 
perform a pull-request.
